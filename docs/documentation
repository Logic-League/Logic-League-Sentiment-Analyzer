Project Overview
The Sentiment Analysis Dashboard is an interactive web application built using Trickle. It allows users to analyze the emotional tone of text data, providing insights into customer feedback, social media posts, and other textual content. The system classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, provides confidence scores, extracts sentiment-driving keywords, and visualizes results for easy interpretation.

7. API Selection Justification
The Sentiment Analyzer uses the Hugging Face API for sentiment and emotion analysis. The Hugging Face API was chosen because it:
•	Provides state-of-the-art NLP models for sentiment and emotion classification
•	Offers accurate and granular sentiment scoring (positive, negative, neutral)
•	Supports detailed emotion detection, including joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and trust
•	Is easy to integrate with React and modern web frameworks
•	Enables real-time analysis, which is critical for an interactive web application
This ensures that both sentiment scores and emotion breakdowns are reliable and fast across different text inputs.
